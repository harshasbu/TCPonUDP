Part 1 :
 
 1. FOR PREVENTING THE BINDING OF MULTICAST ADDRESSES and BROADCAST ADDRESS  we have these additional checks before creating UDP sockets:  
		if (!(ifi->ifi_flags & IFF_BROADCAST))		printf("BCAST ");
		if (!(ifi->ifi_flags & IFF_MULTICAST)	)	printf("MCAST ");
	
	FOR STROING THE DETAILS of each socket We have an array of following DATA STRUCTURES :
		typedef struct {	
			int sockfd;
			struct in_addr ipAddr;
			struct in_addr subnetMask;
			struct in_addr networkAddr;
		
		} sockinfo
		
		Please refer to sockinfo.c for code.
